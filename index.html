<p>Manufacturing consent. Analysis on work done in museums around Iceland using Herman & Chomsky propaganda model</p>
<p>In this paper, the work done in museums around Iceland is analyzed by using Herman and Chomsky’s propaganda model. Theories about the power museums take over history and the truth are documented. When the independence of the museum is looked at, it turns out it isn’t all that much after all. When the work in museums is analyzed using the propaganda model it can clearly be seen that powerful stakeholders largely control the work that is done in museums in Iceland.</p>
